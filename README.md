# FoC-Graded-Parser
This repository was an assignment I completed for The University of Bath on February 2022.
Course: MSc Computer Science
Module: Foundations of Computation

Assignment Background:
Context-free grammars are used extensively in modelling the syntax of programming languages.
A compiler for such a language will include a parser. This is basically an algorithm to determine whether a given string
belongs to the language generated by a given context-free grammar and, if so, construct a parse tree of the string.
The compiler would then go on to translate this parse tree into low-level machine code.

Task:
Implement two different algorithms which determine whether a context-free grammar accepts a given string and, if so,
produce a parse tree for that string.

BF/Parser - implements a brute force approach to finding all possible derivations. Only works on simple strings.
CYK/Parser - implements a more sophisticated approach, using the Cocke-Kasami-Younger algorithm.

Note: For this assignment I only needed to implement the algorithm code found in the two classes shown above.
All other code was provided by the academic staff:
